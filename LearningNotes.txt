Microservices Architecture:
    Gateway APIs : Entrypoint for client request and collecting data from one or more small Microservices.
         Reverse Proxy of Gateway Routing: Internal routing gives a decoupling of internal services and client.
         Request Aggregation: Multiple client requests to be aggregated
         Azure API Management can be used to leverage Gateway APIs
         Ocelot (.Net Core based API)

    CQRS (Command And Query Responsibility )


Smart Endpoints,& Dumb Pipes

Communication Types:
 2 Axes:
  Synchronous Protocol :  Http (it's a Synchronous Protocol based on request/response model)
  Asyncnronous Protocol: other Protocols like AMQP, Messaging
 
  Single Receiver : Command Pattern
  Multiple Receivers: must always be Asyncnronous

  Eventbus, AMQP, Http Polling are few asynchronous Protocol.
